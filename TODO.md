- Figure out whether current efforts are the correct approach, and otherwise what to do
- If current efforts are not in vain, how to unwrap MaybePotD?
- Give PotD values for pre- and post-padded seed
- Need to implement equivalent structs for user-supplied data (seed, date/range)
    - Current implementation of MaybePotD does not account for range
- Implement validators as mod
- Implement errors as enums (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/71812362/rust-error-handling-capturing-multiple-errors)
